1. Added the selectors in the prompt:
#Selectors Missing in Prompt (but used in tests):
.arena-container
.leaderboard-container
.scenario
.battle-ground
#root
but still missing in the model response so i add them in the correctness section.

2. Removed the selectors in the prompt:
.btn
.btn-primary
You can remove these selectors

3. Updated the End to End Test Cases field with latest test available (Also add the test case {........ assert that the two revealed names are not equal}) , also in the annotation file.
4. Updated the Model Response For Concertized Prompt column with MODEL RESPONSE
5. Updated the Execution Screenshot from Model column with screenshot from modal response and ideal code.
6. Remove .cursorindexingignore file from annotation.
